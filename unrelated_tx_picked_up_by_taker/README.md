Was using "Alice" and "Bob" to initiate trades that are brought to completion by "Chris" (mediator).
Completed one trade betwenn Alice and Bob using Chris.
Trade completed successfully.

Started a new trade between Alice and Bob.
When Alice took Bob's offer, all hell broke loose and Alice's offer picked up payout made by Chris on previous trade.
