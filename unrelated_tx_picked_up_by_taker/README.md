Testing Emergency Broadcast functionality on Bisq

Was using "Alice" and "Bob" to initiate trades that are brought to completion by "Chris" (mediator).
Completed one trade betwenn Alice and Bob using Chris.
Trade completed successfully.
Started a new trade between Alice and Bob.
When Alice took Bob's offer, all hell broke loose and Alice's offer picked up payout made by Chris on previous trade.


**Second instance of the problem happned after clearing all Alice and Bob's Bisq directories, and just trading between the two of them.  The fifth trade picked up the payout TX of the fourth trade.**
