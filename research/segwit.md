# Segwit notes

*Written by jmacxx  2020-02-18*


I had a very hard time figuring out how to program segwit transactions.  This document is my notes on the subject.

I ACCEPT NO LIABILITY FOR THE ACCURACY OF THIS DOCUMENT, IT IS MY NOTES ONLY FOR MY OWN PERSONAL USE.

###Prerequisite
An understanding of how legacy transactions are built (see 'Bitcoins the Hard Way' #ref:5)

## What is Segwit?
Segwit (Segregated Witness) is a newer Bitcoin transaction format (circa 2017) which separates the signature from the transaction
data.  The reason for this change is to solve the 'transaction malleability problem' in other words a segwit transaction id
will always be the same even if you build and sign the transaction more than once. (#ref:4)

Primarily I'm going to stick to what I think of as 'pure' segwit (e.g. using bech32 addresses);
there is also what I refer to as 'transitional' segwit which is kind of a mashup between the legacy 
and segwit worlds (known as segwit-embedded-in-P2SH).  It was created so existing wallet software would retain some compatibility; I am not going to consider it right now.

##Types of segwit transactions

P2WPKH - Pay To Witness Public Key Hash

P2WSH - Pay To Witness Script Hash



###P2WPKH
P2WPKH is the easier of the two.  It uses bech32 and is the segwit equivalent of legacy ('1' addresses), i.e. all that 
is needed to spend a UTXO is a private key.  The format of transactions is slightly different than legacy.  
The primary difference is that the transaction hash (aka TxId) is calculated 
by hashing the **data** of the transaction only, whereas in Legacy the TxId is hash of the entire data including signature. (#ref:2)

The witness signature is included in the transaction near the end, just before the locktime field.
Its format is [number of witness fields][length prefixed field][length prefixed field]etc..
The legacy 'scriptSig' field is left empty, i.e. a single '00' byte.
The thing that tells infrastructure if a transaction is segwit or not, is a 'segwit marker' field
which comes directly after the 4 byte transaction version.  The segwit marker is '0001' (2 hex bytes). 
To illustrate it clearly, here is the outline of a legacy compared to a segwit transaction:

    legacy: 01000000      [nIns][prevout][nidx] [scriptSig] [nSequence] [nOuts][amount][addr/script]                      [nLocktime]
    segwit: 01000000 0001 [nIns][prevout][nidx] [00]        [nSequence] [nOuts][amount][addr/script] [nWitness] [witness] [nLocktime]




Witness signature is calculated as follows.  Assemble what is known as the 'hash preimage' from the following available data:

   1. nVersion (4-bytes)
   2. hashPrevouts (32-bytes)           hash of ALL the prevouts
   3. hashSequence (32-bytes)           hash of ALL the nSequence we are using
   4. outpoint (32-bytes + 4-bytes)     the last prevout?
   5. scriptCode (NB. length-prefixed)
   6. in_value of UTXO  (8-bytes)
   7. nSequence of the input (4-bytes)  sequence from outpoint
   8. hashOutputs (32-bytes)
   9. nLocktime of the transaction (usually 0) (4-bytes)
   10. nSighashType (usually 1) (4-bytes)
   (All these fields are fixed length except for the scriptCode).

The preimage is double-SHA256 hashed and the resultant 32 bytes are signed using the private key resulting in the Witness signature.





----
###TxId
The transaction Id is calculated by double-SHA256 hash of the following unsigned block
Note that there is no segwit marker or witness block here.

    [version][nIns][prevout][nidx][00][nSequence][nOuts][amount][addr/script][nLocktime]

    00000000


Note here that the output address field begins with 00 followed by [Push20][ripemd160address].  The 00 is the indicator that the UTXO is Segwit.



In order to spend a segwit UTXO you have to use a segwit transaction:

Here we have a witness that consists of 2 elements: the signature [48 hex bytes long], and the witness script which in this case is a [push_21][public key] because the UTXO type is "witness_v0_keyhash"
The signature must correspond to the hash of the preimage data, signed by the private key.
In other words what bitcoin core does is build the preimage again, and runs a 'signature verification' algorithm. This returns true if the supplied signature was obtained by signing the preimage that matches the public key.


[TODO] If your transaction spends both legacy and segwit UTXOs together, it will also have to be a segwit transaction. [JMC << need to research this more.]

[TODO] P2WSH
